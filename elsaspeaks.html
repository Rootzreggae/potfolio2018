                    <b>A</b>ssistant, is a mobile app that uses AI to help people improve their pronunciation. Users can access
                    different curriculum options based on their interests, such as travel or professional settings. They’re
                    then lead through a series of vocabulary words and phrases, and ELSA's algorithms analyze their speech.
                    If ELSA detects a mispronunciation, it tells the user not only how the word should sound, but also how
                    to move the tongue and lips to form the correct word.</p>


                <p class="t3xt"> With ELSA Speak you can work through a wide range of activities which mainly focus on the individual sounds
                    of English. Most activities involve recording yourself saying a word or phrase. The phrases are topic
                    related (introductions, family, business, food and drink, etc) so not only can you improve your pronunciation,
                    you can also learn phrases that are relevant to your own context.</p>

                        the App background, which is ok if used in different times. The way it is presented draws all the
                        attention to it and combined with the devices makes a very loud visual noise.
