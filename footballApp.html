               coaches and like-minded football fans.</p>
           <p class="t3xt"> 
               Affordability and freedom of a monthly fee are the greatest
               benefit Koeo offers for the true football fans!

    <p class="t3xt">
                I was fairly confident in the product idea, but i first needed to figure out whether the problem 
                is a real one that needs solving. To do this, my best option was to talk to potential users directly. 
                The focus here is on getting qualitative validation of the product idea.
        </p>  
        <p class="t3xt"> I found five people (complete strangers to me, 3 Uber drivers and 2 random people) who said they would be keen to use my hypothetical product. While it doesn’t 
            necessarily guarantee that the problem actually exists or that my proposed solution is good or valuable, it was the simplest way to begin validating the problem 
            i’ve identified.    
        
        </p> 

        <p class="t3xt">
                To broaden my research, i've made a survey and posted on Reddit Portugal. With the survey i gathered quantitative data to build my persona.

        <p class="t3xt">I did a research of indicators of live-stream engagement, focusing in how psychologically attached
            the viewer is to live-stream platforms and specific live-stream communities. I had Twitch as reference.

                    User persona is a method / tool created in product design and development process to 
                    represent the characters of a group pf people. It answers the questions like “For whom we 
                    design the product?” and “What are the characters of this group of people?” which enable 
                    the product made to meet the real needs of its users. User personas also make the product 
                    design process easier by offering a vivid character of users. Based on the data gathered 
                    the persona below was developed.

            When all the steps above were achieved, i went to the stage of wireframing. A wireframe is a simplified and schematic visual representation of a layout for app screens and transitions. It is a fast way to plan the information architecture and ensure that developers and clients get a clear understanding of the project structure.
