           <p> Koeo (acronym for Keep One Eye Open) is a premium Stream & Search app that lets you watch football matches, and interact directly with players, 
               coaches and like-minded football fans.</p>
           <p> 
               Affordability and freedom of a monthly fee are the greatest
               benefit Koeo offers for the true football fans!

                Koeo aims to close the gap between fans and players, providing interaction while watching a stream, and a greater sense of virtual community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Football entities such as players and coaches are verified and are automatically granted mod access. This provides control for the professionals and behavioural responsabilities for the fans
            </p>
            <p> The overall goal of this project is to showcase that as a Designer i am fluid, and i can adapt with the work at hand. This includes interface design, user research, illustration and some front-end coding (this website).</p>

            This project was born from failure. A failed challenge for a company i have applied. Despite not getting the position, 
            i really liked the idea and as such, i took the motive and opportunity
            to build something that i believe in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the general idea of the product down, but i had a million questions and like...three answers!
                 </p>
                 <h2>The process</h2>

                 <p>
                     I sought to answer the main questions i had:
                                     </p>
                 <ol>
                                            <li> <b>The problem: </b> is this problem worth solving? Do users think this is a major problem? Is my solution appealing?</li>
                                            <li> <b>The market:</b> Some users might agree that this is a problem worth solving. But are there enough of them to make up a market for my product?  </li>
                                            <li> <b>The product:</b> The problem might exist, but does my product actually solve it?  </li>
                                            <li> <b>Willingness to pay:</b> There is market demand and a great product idea. But will people actually be willing to reach into their wallets and pay for it? </li>
                                     </ol>

    <h1>Conducting user research</h1>    
    
    <p>
                I was fairly confident in the product idea, but i first needed to figure out whether the problem 
                is a real one that needs solving. To do this, my best option was to talk to potential users directly. 
                The focus here is on getting qualitative validation of the product idea.
        </p>  
        <p> I found five people (complete strangers to me, 3 Uber drivers and 2 random people) who said they would be keen to use my hypothetical product. While it doesn’t 
            necessarily guarantee that the problem actually exists or that my proposed solution is good or valuable, it was the simplest way to begin validating the problem 
            i’ve identified.    
        
        </p> 

        <p>
                To broaden my research, i've made a survey and posted on Reddit Portugal. With the survey i gathered quantitative data to build my persona.
